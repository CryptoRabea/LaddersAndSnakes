# Board Generation Guide

This guide explains how to generate and configure the default Snakes and Ladders board in your Unity scene.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)

1. Open your game scene in Unity
2. Go to the Unity menu: **LAS → Setup Default Board in Scene**
3. Done! The board will be automatically generated with all components configured.

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Create the BoardConfig asset:
   - Menu: **LAS → Create Default Board Config**
   - This creates `Assets/Config/DefaultBoardConfig.asset` with default snakes and ladders

2. Add BoardGenerator to your scene:
   - Create an empty GameObject
   - Add the `BoardGenerator` component
   - The board will generate automatically on Start

3. Configure BoardManager and BoardModel:
   - Find/Create `BoardManager` GameObject
   - Assign the `DefaultBoardConfig` asset to the `boardConfig` field
   - Assign the `BoardParent` transform (generated by BoardGenerator)
   - Find/Create `BoardModel` GameObject
   - Assign the `DefaultBoardConfig` asset to the `config` field

## Board Specifications

### Grid Layout
- **Size:** 10x10 grid (100 tiles)
- **Numbering:** Starts at bottom-left (1), zigzags to top-right (100)
- **Tile Size:** 1.5 units
- **Tile Spacing:** 0.1 units

### Colors
Tiles are randomly colored using a vibrant palette:
- Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Pink, Purple, White

### Snakes (Head → Tail)
- 98 → 78
- 95 → 75
- 92 → 73
- 87 → 36
- 64 → 60
- 62 → 19
- 54 → 34
- 17 → 7

### Ladders (Bottom → Top)
- 4 → 14
- 9 → 31
- 21 → 42
- 28 → 84
- 40 → 63
- 51 → 67
- 71 → 91

### Special Features
- **Tile 100:** Marked with golden color and trophy
- **Golden Border:** Surrounds the entire board
- **Snake Heads:** Tiles are darkened to indicate snake starting position
- **Ladder Bases:** Tiles are brightened to indicate ladder starting position

## Generated Hierarchy

    ├── ...
    ├── Tile_100
    ├── Snake_98_to_78
    ├── Snake_95_to_75

```

## Components

### BoardGenerator.cs
Generates the visual board at runtime:
- Creates 100 colored tiles in zigzag pattern
- Generates snake visuals (curved green lines)
- Generates ladder visuals (purple and white)
- Creates golden border
- Adds number labels to each tile

### BoardConfig.asset
ScriptableObject containing:
- List of jumps (snakes and ladders)
- Optional tile data array

### BoardManager.cs
Manages board logic:
- Tile position lookup
- Jump detection (snakes/ladders)
- Integration with game systems

### BoardModel.cs
Simplified board model:
- Fast jump lookup using dictionary
- Used by movement system

## Menu Items

### LAS → Setup Default Board in Scene
Automatically creates and configures everything:
- Creates BoardConfig if needed
- Generates visual board
- Sets up BoardManager
- Sets up BoardModel
- Links all components together

### LAS → Create Default Board Config
Creates/updates the BoardConfig asset with default snakes and ladders.

### LAS → Select Board Config
Quickly select the BoardConfig asset in the project window.

### LAS → Clear Board from Scene
Removes the BoardGenerator and all generated tiles from the scene.

## Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit the `tileColors` array in `BoardGenerator.cs`:
```csharp
private Color[] tileColors = new Color[]
{
    new Color(1f, 0f, 0f),  // Red
    // Add your custom colors here
};
```

### Adding/Removing Snakes
Edit the `snakes` array in `BoardGenerator.cs` or update the BoardConfig asset:
```csharp
private int[,] snakes = new int[,]
{
    {98, 78},  // from, to
    // Add more snakes
};
```

### Changing Board Size
Modify the `rows`, `columns`, `tileSize`, and `tileSpacing` fields in the BoardGenerator component inspector.

### Custom Visuals
The current implementation uses basic Unity primitives. You can replace them with:
- Custom 3D models for tiles
- Sprite-based 2D tiles
- Particle effects for snakes/ladders
- Custom materials and shaders

## Integration with Game Systems

The board integrates seamlessly with:
- **MovementSystem:** Uses BoardModel for jump detection
- **PlayerPiece:** Moves along tile positions from BoardManager
- **GameController:** Manages game state and turns
- **EventBus:** All actions are event-driven

## Notes

- The board generates automatically on Start if `generateOnStart` is enabled
- You can regenerate the board at runtime by calling `boardGenerator.GenerateBoard()`
- The system supports both visual boards and logical-only boards
- All jumps are configured in BoardConfig for easy editing

## Troubleshooting

**Board not appearing:**
- Check that BoardGenerator has `generateOnStart` enabled
- Verify the BoardGenerator GameObject is active
- Check console for errors

**Snakes/Ladders not working:**
- Ensure BoardModel has the BoardConfig assigned
- Check that BoardConfig.jumps is populated
- Verify the BoardModel.Awake() is being called

**Wrong tile positions:**
- Check BoardManager has the correct boardParent reference
- Verify tiles are children of BoardParent
- Ensure tiles are numbered correctly (Tile_1, Tile_2, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

You mentioned adding 3D graphics later. To do this:
1. Create your 3D tile prefab
2. Modify `CreateTile()` in BoardGenerator to instantiate your prefab
3. Create custom snake and ladder 3D models
4. Replace the primitive shapes with your models
